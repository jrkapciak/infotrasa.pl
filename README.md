Project is in early state of development -> it's working almost as intendent but with many 'temporary' solution. Infotrasa was created be we with 'ZERO' knownlage about how proper web app should look like. In early days of 2018 I plan to rewrite whole project to use django - REST - leaflet. Treat it like na backup version/learning/demo.
